# 2048 AI

AI for the game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

See it in action [here](http://mbrubeck.github.io/2048-AI/). (Hit the auto-run
button to let the AI attempt to solve it by itself)

Based on the AI solver by [Matt Overlan](http://github.com/ov3y/2048-AI/).  I
just made a trivial change to make the AI search for the worst score rather
than the best.
